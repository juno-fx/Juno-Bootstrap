# CoreWeave SIG

This directory contains the deployment configurations for the CoreWeave special interest group (SIG) of Juno.

Because CoreWeave is already built on kubernetes and presents a GPU-enabled environment, the configurations here are 
tailored to leverage the existing infrastructure and services provided by CoreWeave.

## Services

The following services are included in the CoreWeave SIG:

- **[NGINX Ingress](ingress/README.md)**: Configuration for deploying NGINX as an ingress controller.
