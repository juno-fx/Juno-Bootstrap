  ### ArgoCD repo authentications
  # This section allows you to configure authentication for
  # ArgoCD to access private repositories. This is a direct
  # mapping to the ArgoCD repo-creds secrets. The stringData
  # section is a yaml pass-through. So you don't need to
  # use username and password, you can use any of the supported
  # authentication methods supported by ArgoCD.

### Extra Deployments
# This provides an easy way to hook in additional custom
# ArgoCD compatible Helm Applications.
#
# Any additional values you want to pass to the deployment
# can be added normally to this file. For example, to pass
# a custom value of `customValue` to each deployment, you
# can add it to this file as follows:
#my-extra-deployment:
#  customValue: "my-custom-value"
#  nested:
#    thing: "works!"
# Then access it in your chart as follows:
# {{ .Values.customValue }}
extraDeployments:
#  - repoURL: https://some-git-repo.com
#    path: .
#    targetRevision: main
#    name: my-extra-deployment
#    namespace: my-namespace

# This only needs to be filled in for airgapped installs that bootstrap the cluster with our oneclick installer / helper script.
# It relies on a local registry mirror, such as Harbor's proxycache projects.
# It removes the need to adjust all images and their respective imagePullSecrets
# It follows syntax of: https://docs.k3s.io/installation/private-registry
# When possible, it's recommended to use registry rewrites itself in containerd, also documented in the above URL
